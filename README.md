## Why you should use Aimwork

There's no point reinventing the wheel, so there's no point making your own `GetClosestPlayerToCursor` function when Aimwork exists. Aimwork handles everything for you, in an optimised way. It's likely to be far more performant than anything you can make yourself. The goal of Aimwork is to handle hundreds of players with mininal (as low as 0) FPS impact. This isn't the benefits though. There are many more:

- Insane Optimisations
  > Aimwork has been written from the ground up to be as optimised as possible
- Reputable
  > The developers behind Aimwork are well known in the community, often given the title of the first person to make a [Da Hood](https://www.roblox.com/games/2788229376/Da-Hood) [silent aim](https://v3rmillion.rip/showthread.php?tid=979929) in 2020
- Free and Open Source
  > The code behind Aimwork is one of the most high quality Roblox scripts out there. Not only that, but it's free and open source
